            <h2>About Me</h2>
             <P>My name is Yan Zhang, my friends call me <abbr title="Hypertext Markup language">Ale</abbr>. That is short for <em>Alessia</em>, which is an Italian name I picked up during my studies in Italy. I chose this program because it is related to my background in art design, but it also introduced me to new things like <abbr title="Hypertext Markup language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Hypertext Markup language">CSS</abbr>. I am really into web development now and want to switch my career in that directionâ€”I feel it seems like a great move for my future.</P>
            <p>I recently started dancing and this is my first time trying it, like jazz and k-pop. Even though I am not the most graceful dancer, I am enjoying the challenge and learning a lot from it. I also enjoy swimming, skiing, and baking, so if anyone wants to join me for any of those activities, just let me know!
