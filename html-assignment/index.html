            <h2>About Me</h2>
             <p>My name is Yan Zhang, my friends call me Ale. That is short for <em>Alessia</em>, which is an Italian name I picked up during my studies in Italy. I chose this program because it is related to my background in art design, but it also introduced me to new things like <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. I am really into web development now and want to switch my career in that direction. I feel it seems like a great move for my future.</p>
            <p>I recently started dancing and this is my first time trying it, like jazz and k-pop. Even though I am not the most graceful dancer, I am enjoying the challenge and learning a lot from it. I also enjoy swimming, skiing, and baking, so if anyone wants to join me for any of those activities, just let me know!</p>
            <p>My favorite famous quote is:</p> <blockquote>Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.<sup>1</sup> -<cite>Oscar Wilde</cite></blockquote>
